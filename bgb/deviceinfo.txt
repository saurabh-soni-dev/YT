Here is an example of a functional component that uses the react-native-device-info library to display the device name and device ID:

Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info';

const DeviceInfoScreen = () => {
  const deviceName = DeviceInfo.getDeviceName();
  const deviceId = DeviceInfo.getDeviceId();

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Device Name: {deviceName}</Text>
      <Text>Device ID: {deviceId}</Text>
    </>
  );
}

export default DeviceInfoScreen;
Please make sure to install react-native-device-info and link it to your project before trying to use it.

Copy code
npm install react-native-device-info

react-native link react-native-device-info
