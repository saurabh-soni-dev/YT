Here is an example of a functional component in React Native that uses the TextInput and TTS (Text-to-Speech) modules:

Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import { TextToSpeech } from 'react-native-tts';

const SpeechInput = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const speak = async () => {
    try {
      await TextToSpeech.speak(text);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput
        value={text}
        onChangeText={(value) => setText(value)}
        placeholder="Enter text to speak"
      />
      <Button title="Speak" onPress={speak} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default SpeechInput;
In this example, the component has a TextInput field that allows the user to enter text, and a button labeled "Speak" that, when pressed, uses the TTS module to speak the text that was entered.

You will need to install TTS package in order to use this example

Copy code
npm install react-native-tts
Also remember to link the package

Copy code
react-native link react-native-tts
This is a basic example, you can customize it as per your requirement.
